# ImageFiltersWPF

This project contains implemented Binarization and gauss filter for choosen images. Made for university, I did not pay attention to details (like api). Used mvvm pattern, used build in dependency injection mechanism. Project does not feature quality code at all, there was no point for me to put more work into this university project.
